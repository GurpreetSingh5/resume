PERSONAL
Hobbies
I am a NAUI certiﬁed SCUBA diver, avid mountaineer, skier and sailor. I spent most of my life exploring the Northwest National Forests and Puget Sound. Growing up I played eight years of premier soccer and a ninth year as a freshman in college. I now play for fun on Bay Area teams to keep ﬁt. I try to keep my blog updated at adamchristian.com, so my family and friends can follow my adventures.
Travel
I have spent a summer in Australia volunteering at wildlife refuges and conservation parks, diving on the barrier reef and repelling off the cliffs of the Blue Mountains. I also spent a summer in Iceland exploring the mid atlantic rift, and the volcanoes of Vestmannaeyjar. My most recent excursion was to the Scottish Highland Way where I explored the castles, towns and distilleries.
Music
I have played electric and acoustic guitar for 10 years, and like to keep up on my tablature reading and song libraries. I was inspired by seeing Eric Johnson and Joe Satriani in concert in Spokane Washington.
