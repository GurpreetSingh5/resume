PERSONAL
========
I am a NAUI certiﬁed SCUBA diver, avid mountaineer, skier and sailor. I spent most of my life exploring the Northwest National Forests and Puget Sound. I've spent the last 5 years studying linguistics, specifically the German language and speaking at conferences about language learning techniques. I really enjoy traveling and exploring new places, constantly learning, and building out development projects on the side to keep my skills sharp and up-to date.
